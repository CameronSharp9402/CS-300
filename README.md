## Reflection
For these projects, I had to provide a computer science course storage and presentation solution to ABCU's academic advisors. The initial problem was to read course data from a file, validate the data, put it into an appropriate data structure, and give the user the capability of searching for course data or printing the courses out in ascending alphanumeric order. To address this, I implemented and compared three primary data structures, vector, hash table, and binary search tree, according to their runtime and memory efficiency on performing operations such as loading data, searching, and sorting. Knowing how each structure would influence algorithm performance was critical in making the best choice to implement within the application. Throughout this process, I encountered standard issues with managing prerequisites, maintaining consistency with the data, and ensuring that the structures facilitate efficient lookups and sorted results. I was able to overcome these through the use of data structuring fundamentals and going over my pseudocode multiple times. Such projects made me more appreciative for using the appropriate data structure based on the problem domain and defined the manner in which I organize the software for it to be module based, readable, and extendable. They also reinforced coding standards for producing easily readable code by demonstrating good logic, a clean architecture, and good documentation, things which I currently more consciously set into practice.
